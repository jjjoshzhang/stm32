// stm32 F103C8T6

    important/special pins
    VDD: supply volatage
    VSS: ground
    NRST(Active low): reset
    VBAT: backup power supply for RTC and backup everthing when vdd is dead
    BOOt0: boot mode selection pin


    normal pins(functionality are similar)
    GPIO
    GPIO A PA0-PA15
    GPIO B PB0-PB15
    GPIO C PC13-PC15
    GPIO D PD0-PD1

    - Iputs

    Input pull-uo
    Input pull-down
    Input floating
    Analog input

    - Outputs
    Output push-pull
    Output open-drain
    Alternate function push-pull
    Alternate function open-drain

    API
    a created function inside a library to do a specific task
    ex: GPIO_Init() initialize hot a GPIO pin behaves
 

    USART
    Focuses on Tx(Transmit) and Rx(receive)data
    Full Duplex (ur RX connects to another cpu's tx, ur TX connects to another cpus's rx)
    Half Duplex sync (TX connects to TX send data or receive data at a time)

    say for printf function if we want accn want to write bytes to USART we need to override it 
    bc it's inner functions r sometimes just a placehlder does not drive the UART hardware Z



    I2C
    allows mutilple communications between microcontroller and slave devices
    SCL(CLOCK) and SDA(DATA)
    pull up resistors and open drain circuit 
    0 connectes to gnd 1 connects to pull up resistors 
    each cycle of SCL(clocks) will receive a bit of data on SDA
